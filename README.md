Converted a relational design into tables in SQL Server

In this project, I have worked on converting a relational design that enlists various
users, their roles, user accounts and their statuses into different tables in SQL
Server and inserted data into them.
Having at least two rows in each of the tables,
I have created respective foreign key to show the relationship between the Tables
